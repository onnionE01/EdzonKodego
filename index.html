		A <b>tuna</b> is a saltwater fish that belongs to the tribe Thunnini, a subgrouping of the Scombridae (mackerel) family. The Thunnini comprise 15 species across five genera,<sup>[2]</sup> the sizes of which vary greatly, ranging from the bullet tuna <i> (max length: 50 cm or 1.6 ft, weight: 1.8 kg or 4 lb)</i> up to the Atlantic bluefin tuna <i> (max length: 4.6 m or 15 ft, weight: 684 kg or 1,508 lb),</i> which averages 2 m (6.6 ft) and is believed to live up to 50 years.

		<b>Tuna</b>, opah and mackerel sharks are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water. An active and agile predator, the tuna has a sleek, streamlined body, and is among the fastest-swimming pelagic fish â€“ the yellowfin tuna, for example, is capable of speeds of up to 75 km/h (47 mph).<sup>[3][4]</sup> Greatly inflated speeds can be found in early scientific reports and are still widely reported in the popular literature.<sup>[4]</sup>

		Found in warm seas, the tuna is commercially fished extensively as a food fish, and is popular as a bluewater game fish. As a result of overfishing, some tuna species, such as the southern bluefin tuna, are threatened with extinction.<sup>[5]</sup>
